PrepareSchema in environments that have empty root AD domain | July secruity update for Exchange 2013 have shipped schema changes and needs Exchange role installed for PrepareSchema, this makes it difficult for environments that have Exchange 2013 as the highest installed Exchange server and do not have an Exchange server installed in the same AD site as that of root AD domain. | Option 1 <BR>	Introduce a new server that meets system requirements for Exchange 2013 Management tools, in the root AD domain.
